# Lid-Driven-cavity-problem
Numerical solution of steady 2D Navier-Stokes eqns for Lid-driven cavity problem 
– Used a coupled stream function-vorticity formulation (PDEs) to represent the flow domain.
– Applied FDM for PDE discretization, set up boundary conditions, and plotted stream function & vorticity fields
